# GitHub Issue Templates for Teachers

This repository now includes structured issue templates to help teachers easily request changes and report problems with the High School Management System. These templates guide you through providing all the necessary information so that the Copilot coding agent can understand and implement your requests without needing additional clarification.

## Available Templates

When you create a new issue in GitHub, you'll see these template options:

### üéØ **Add New Activity**

## What Makes These Templates Effective

Each template includes the **four essential elements** for successful Copilot agent implementation:

1. **üìù Clear Problem Description** - What challenge needs to be solved?
2. **‚úÖ Clear Acceptance Criteria** - How will you know it's done correctly?
3. **üí° Implementation Hints** - Technical guidance for the developer
4. **üîç Context & Limitations** - Additional information and constraints

## How to Use These Templates

1. **Go to the Issues tab** in the GitHub repository
2. **Click "New Issue"**
3. **Choose the appropriate template** that matches your request type
4. **Fill out all required fields** - the more detail you provide, the better the result
5. **Submit the issue** - it will be automatically assigned to the Copilot agent

## Benefits for Teachers

- **No Technical Knowledge Required** - Templates guide you through what information is needed
- **Faster Implementation** - Complete information means no back-and-forth clarification
- **Better Results** - Detailed requirements lead to solutions that meet your actual needs
- **Consistent Quality** - Every request includes testing and acceptance criteria
